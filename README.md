# RationalityProtocol

## Terms

Belief - a proposition that a person holds as true
Evidence - data or information that supports or contradicts a belief
Bias - a predisposition or prejudice in favor of or against a particular idea
Instrumental rationality - the ability to choose the best available means to achieve a given goal
Epistemic rationality - the ability to form and update beliefs in the direction of the truth

## Start questions

1. Are you ready to change your belief in the face of valid evidence?
Yes

2. Formulate your belief as a simple statement. If it is a complex statement,
break it down into simple statements and evaluate each one separately.
Good criteria that a statement is simple is that you can invert it and as result you would have two mutually exclusive hypotheses only one of which can be true

- If no, this protocol won't help you. Your beliefs are not based on reality

- If yes, go to 2
